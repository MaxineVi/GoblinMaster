---take aim
When you **take aim and fire at an enemy at range**, roll+GRA. On a 10+, your shot is clear, deal your damage. On a 7-9, choose one, and then deal your damage.

• You have to take several shots, reducing your ammo by one.
---stand strong
When you **stand in defense of a person, item, or location**, roll+HRD. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. So long as you stand in defense, when something makes a move for or the thing you defend is attacked you may spend hold, 1 for 1, to choose an option:
• Redirect an attack from the thing you defend to yourself
• Halve the attack’s effect or damage
• Open up the attacker to an ally giving that ally +1 forward against the attacker
• Deal your damage to the attacker
---defy danger

• by darting out of the way or moving quickly, +GRA
• through mental fortitude, +WOR
• with quick thinking or manipulation, +PRS
• by toughing it out, +HRD
On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the threat doesn’t come to bear. On a 7-9, you stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the GM will offer you a hard bargain, or an ugly choice.
---good with your hands
When you **pick a lock, disable a trap or tinker with something risky**, roll+CAP. On a 10+, you do it, no problem. On a 7-9, you still do it, but the GM will offer you two options between suspicion, danger, or cost.
---elegance without witness
When you **use delicate movements to pick a pocket, eavesdrop or tail someone**, roll+GRA. On a 10+, you’re practically invisible. On a 7-9, you can stay or go, but if you go it costs you: leave something behind or take something with you, the GM will tell you what.

• What here is not what it appears to be?
---spout lore
When you **consult your accumulated knowledge about something**, roll+WOR. On a 10+, the GM will tell you something interesting and useful about the subject relevant to your situation.

---manipulate
When you **attempt to convince or manipulate someone** to do or think something they might not agree with, tell them what you want or want them to think and roll+PRS. For an NPC: On a 7+, they ask you for something and do it if you make them a promise first. On a 7-9, they need some concrete assurance of your promise, right now. For a PC: On a 7+, if they do it, they mark experience. On a 10+, they take +1 forward if they do what you ask. On a 6-, they mark experience if they ***don’t*** do what you ask and you don’t mark experience.

• What does your character wish I’d do?
• How could I get your character to __?

---last breath
When you’re dying and you catch a glimpse of what lies beyond this miserable life, there is no one to greet you on the other side, it is just a vast ocean of darkness, it feels empty and lonely. You are afraid. Now roll+nothing. On a 10+, you’ve cheated death, you’re in a bad spot but you’re still alive. On a 7-9, there is no manifestation of death to greet you on the other side. But you can feel fate asking for something, a sacrifice perhaps, make a considerable sacrifice and stabilize or pass into whatever fate awaits you here. On a miss, your fate is sealed. You can feel the tendrils of darkness reaching out to you from beyond life, you’ll cross the threshold soon. The GM will tell you when.
---encumbrance
When you **make a move while carrying weight up to or equal to Load**, you’re fine. When you make a move while carrying weight equal to load+1 or load+2, you take -1. When you make a move while carrying weight greater than load+2, you have a choice: drop at least 1 weight and roll at -1, or automatically fail.
---bolster
When you **spend your leisure time in study, meditation, or hard practice**, you gain preparation. If you prepare for a week or two, 1 preparation.

On a 7-9, you’ll have to pay more or settle for something similar.
---recover
When you **do nothing but rest in comfort and safety** after a day of rest you recover all your HP. After three days of rest you remove one debility of your choice. If you’re under the care of a healer (magical or otherwise) you heal a debility for every two days of rest instead.
---end of session
When you **reach the end of a session** of The Hollow World, choose one of your bonds that you feel is resolved (completely explored, no longer relevant, or otherwise). Ask the player of the character you have the bond with if they agree. If they do, mark XP and write a new bond with whomever you wish.
Once bonds have been updated look at your drive. If you fulfilled that drive at least once this session, mark XP. Then answer these three questions as a group:
• Did we learn something new and important about the world?
• Did we overcome a notable monster or enemy?
• Did we loot a memorable treasure?
For each “yes” answer everyone marks XP.
---level up
When you **have downtime (hours or days) and XP equal to (or greater than) your current level+7**, subtract your current level+7 from your XP, increase your level by 1, and choose a new advanced move from your class. Choose one of your stats and increase it by 1 (this may change your modifier).
*Note that changing your Hardy increases your maximum and current HP. Ability scores can’t go higher than 18.*
---outstanding warrants
When you **return to a civilized place in which you’ve caused trouble before**, roll+PRS. On a hit, word has spread of your deeds and everyone recognizes you. On a 7-9, that, and, the GM chooses a complication:

• A group of \_\_ (porters, guards, minstrels, angry farmers, etc.)
• A skilled \_\_ (guide, sage, burglar, bodyguard, etc.)
A group is a follower like any other, but with the *Group* tag.
If the GM says you can’t find that kind of help in a place like this, start over or move on. Otherwise, roll+nothing and take +1 if you have a good reputation in these parts. On a 10+, they’re yours for the hiring. On a 7-9, the GM chooses 1 from the list below. On a miss, No one shows, but mark XP.
• They demand greater compensation, in silver or some other form
• No one here fits the bill, but you hear of someone elsewhere who does
• They have a need that must be met first (permission from someone else, a favor, etc.)
• You can tell at a glance they are less than ideal (ask the GM how)
The GM will choose or roll their specifics (Quality, Loyalty, Instinct, Cost, tags, etc.) as needed, to be discovered through play. Which might involve you grilling them, right now.
---order follower
When you **order or expect a follower to do something dangerous, degrading, or contrary to their Instinct**, roll+Loyalty. On a 10+, they do it, now. On a 7-9, they do it, but the GM picks one from the list below.

• They complain loudly, now or later, and demand something in return
• Caution, unwillingness, or fear makes them take a long time to get it done
---do their thing
When a follower **does something chancy within the scope of their tags or moves**, roll+Quality. On a 10+, they do it, as well as one could reasonably hope. On a 7-9, they do it, but there’s an unforeseen cost, consequence, or limitation (ask the GM what).
When a follower **does something chancy that falls beyond the scope of their tags or moves**, or does anything on their own, the GM will tell you what happens.
---call for assistance
When a follower **helps you make a move that calls for a roll**, take +1 to that roll but know that they will be exposed to any potential consequences.

When a follower **helps you Stand Strong**, you can spend 1 hold to redirect an attack to them instead of yourself.
---pay up
When you **pay a follower’s cost**, increase their Loyalty by 1 (to a maximum of +3). You can’t trigger this move again until both you and your follower have Made Camp.

from -1 to +2 (or even +3 if it’s truly magnificent). Set its Loyalty as with any new follower. Choose (or make up) a Cost. Add any tags you deem appropriate, but otherwise use as-is.
When you **turn a follower into a monster**, use their stats as-is.
---journey
When you **travel by a safe route**, through safe or dangerous lands, indicate your destination on the map. The GM will tell you how long the trip takes, and what (if anything) happens along the way.
