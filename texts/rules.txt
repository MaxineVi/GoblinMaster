---hack & slash
When you **attack an enemy in melee**, roll+Str. On a 10+ you deal your damage to the enemy and avoid their attack. At your option, you may choose to do +1d6 damage but expose yourself to the enemy’s attack. On a 7–9, you deal your damage to the enemy and the enemy makes an attack against you.
---volley
When you take aim and **shoot at an enemy at range**, roll+Dex. On a 10+ you have a clear shot—deal your damage. On a 7–9, choose one (whichever you choose you deal your damage):
• You have to move to get the shot placing you in danger of the GM’s choice
• You have to take what you can get: -1d6 damage
• You have to take several shots, reducing your ammo by one.
---parley
When you **have leverage on a GM character and manipulate them**, roll+Cha. Leverage is something they need or want. On a hit they ask you for something and do it if you make them a promise first. On a 7–9, they need some concrete assurance of your promise, right now.
---defy danger
When you **act despite an imminent threat** or suffer a calamity, say how you deal with it and roll. If you do it...
• by powering through, +Str
• by getting out of the way or acting fast, +Dex
• by enduring, +Con
• with quick thinking, +Int
• through mental fortitude, +Wis
• sing charm and social grace, +Cha
On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the threat doesn’t come to bear. On a 7–9, you stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.
---defend
When you **stand in defense of a person, item, or location** under attack, roll+Con. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7–9, hold 1. So long as you stand in defense, when you or the thing you defend is attacked you may spend hold, 1 for 1, to choose an option:
• Redirect an attack from the thing you defend to yourself
• Halve the attack’s effect or damage
• Open up the attacker to an ally giving that ally +1 forward against the attacker
• Deal damage to the attacker equal to your level
---Discern Realities
When you **closely study a situation or person**, roll+Wis. On a 10+ ask the GM three questions from the list below. On a 7–9 ask only one. Take +1 forward when acting on the answers.
• What happened here recently?
• What is about to happen?
• What should I be on the lookout for?
• What here is useful or valuable to me?
• Who’s really in control here?
• What here is not what it appears to be?
---spout lore
When you **consult your accumulated knowledge about something**, roll+Int. On a 10+ the GM will tell you something interesting and useful about the subject relevant to your situation. On a 7–9 the GM will only tell you something interesting—it’s on you to make it useful. The GM might ask you “How do you know this?” Tell them the truth, now.
---aid or interfere
When you **help or hinder someone you have a Bond with**, roll+Bond with them. On a hit they take +1 or -2, your choice. On a 7–9 you also expose yourself to danger, retribution, or cost.
---last breath
When you’re dying you catch a glimpse of what lies beyond the Black Gates of Death’s Kingdom (the GM will describe it). Then roll (just roll, +nothing—yeah, Death doesn’t care how tough or cool you are). On a 10+ you’ve cheated death— you’re in a bad spot but you’re still alive. On a 7–9 Death will offer you a bargain. Take it and stabilize or refuse and pass beyond the Black Gates into whatever fate awaits you. On a miss, your fate is sealed. You’re marked as Death’s own and you’ll cross the threshold soon. The GM will tell you when.
---encumbrance
When you **make a move while carrying weight up to or equal to Load**, you’re fine. When you make a move while carrying weight equal to load+1 or load+2, you take -1. When you make a move while carrying weight greater than load+2, you have a choice: drop at least 1 weight and roll at -1, or automatically fail.
---make camp
When you **settle in to rest consume a ration**; If you’re somewhere dangerous decide the watch order as well. If you have enough XP you may Level Up. When you wake from at least a few uninterrupted hours of sleep heal damage equal to half your max HP.
---take watch
When you’re **on watch and something approaches the camp**, roll+Wis. On a 10+ you’re able to wake the camp and prepare a response, the camp takes +1 forward. On a 7–9 you react just a moment too late; the camp is awake but hasn’t had time to prepare. You have weapons and armor but little else. On a miss whatever lurks outside the campfire’s light has the drop on you.
---bolster
When you **spend your leisure time in study, meditation, or hard practice**, you gain preparation. If you prepare for a week or two, 1 preparation. If you prepare for a month or longer, 3 preparation. When your preparation pays off spend 1 preparation for +1 to any roll. You can only spend one preparation per roll.
---supply
When you go to **buy something with money on hand**, if it’s something readily available in the settlement you’re in, you can buy it at market price. If it’s something special, beyond what’s usually available here, or non-mundane, roll+Cha. On a 10+ you find what you’re looking for at a fair price. On a 7–9 you’ll have to pay more or settle for something similar.
---undertake a perilous journey
When you **travel through hostile territory**, choose one member of the party to act as trailblazer, one to scout ahead, and one to be quartermaster (the same character cannot have two jobs). If you don’t have enough party members or choose not to assign a job, treat that job as if it had rolled a 6. Each character with a job to do rolls+Wis. On a 10+ the quartermaster reduces the number of rations required by one. On a 10+ the trailblazer reduces the amount of time it takes to reach your destination (the GM will say by how much). On a 10+ the scout will spot any trouble quick enough to let you get the drop on it. On a 7–9 each roles performs their job as expected: the normal number of rations are consumed, the journey takes about as long as expected, no one gets the drop on you but you don’t get the drop on them either.
---recover
When you do nothing but rest in comfort and safety after a day of rest you recover all your HP. After three days of rest you remove one debility of your choice. If you’re under the care of a healer (magical or otherwise) you heal a debility for every two days of rest instead.
---carouse
When you **return triumphant and throw a big party**, spend 100 coin and roll + extra 100s of coin spent. On a 10+ choose 3. On a 7–9 choose 1. On a miss, you still choose one, but things get really out of hand.
• You befriend a useful NPC
• You hear rumors of an opportunity
• You gain useful information
• You are not entangled, ensorcelled, or tricked
---recruit
When you **put out word that you’re looking to hire help**, roll. If you make it known...
• ...that your pay is generous, take +1
• ...what you’re setting out to do, take +1
• ...that they’ll get a share of whatever you find, take +1
If you have a useful reputation around these parts take an additional +1. On a 10+ you’ve got your pick of a number of skilled applicants, your choice who you hire, no penalty for not taking them along. On a 7–9 you’ll have to settle for someone close or turn them away. On a miss someone influential and ill-suited declares they’d like to come along (a foolhardy youth, a loose-cannon, or a veiled enemy, for example), bring them and take the consequences or turn them away. If you turn away applicants you take -1 forward to Recruit.
---end of session
When you **reach the end of a session**, choose one your bonds that you feel is resolved (completely explored, no longer relevant, or otherwise). Ask the player of the character you have the bond with if they agree. If they do, mark XP and write a new bond with whomever you wish. Once bonds have been updated look at your alignment. If you fulfilled that alignment at least once this session, mark XP. Then answer these three questions as a group:
• Did we learn something new and important about the world?
• Did we overcome a notable monster or enemy?
• Did we loot a memorable treasure?
For each “yes” answer everyone marks XP.
---level up
When you have **downtime (hours or days) and XP equal to (or greater than) your current level+7**, subtract your current level +7 from your XP, increase your level by 1, and choose a new advanced move from your class. If you are the wizard, you also get to add a new spell to your spellbook. Choose one of your stats and increase it by 1 (this may change your modifier).
*Note that changing your Constitution increases your maximum and current HP. Ability scores can’t go higher than 18.*
---outstanding warrants
When you **return to a civilized place in which you’ve caused trouble before**, roll+Cha. On a hit, word has spread of your deeds and everyone recognizes you. On a 7–9, that, and, the GM chooses a complication:
• The local constabulary has a warrant out for your arrest
• Someone has put a price on your head
• Someone important to you has been put in a bad spot as a result of your actions
---the upper hand
You take +1 ongoing to last breath rolls. When you **take your last breath**, on a 7–9 you make an offer to Death in return for your life. If Death accepts he will return you to life. If not, you die.
---what are you waiting for?
When you cry out a challenge to your enemies, roll+Con. On a 10+ they treat you as the most obvious threat to be dealt with and ignore your companions, take +2 damage ongoing against them. On a 7–9 only a few (the weakest or most foolhardy among them) fall prey to your taunting.
---herculean appetites
Others may content themselves with just a taste of wine, or dominion over a servant or two, but you want more. Choose two appetites. While **pursuing one of your appetites if you would roll for a move**, instead of rolling 2d6 you roll 1d6+1d8. If the d6 is the higher die of the pair, the GM will also introduce a complication or danger that comes about due to your heedless pursuits.
• Pure destruction
• Power over others
• Mortal pleasures
• Conquest
• Riches and property
• Fame and glory
---outsider
You may be elf, dwarf, halfling, or human, but you and your people are not from around here. At the beginning of each session, the GM will **ask you something about your homeland**, why you left, or what you left behind. If you answer them, mark XP.
---arcane art
When you **weave a performance into a basic spell**, choose an ally and an effect:
• Heal 1d8 damage
• +1d4 forward to damage
• Their mind is shaken clear of one enchantment
• The next time someone successfully assists the target with aid, they get +2 instead of +1
Then roll+CHA. On a 10+, the ally gets the selected effect. On a 7-9, your spell still works, but you draw unwanted attention or your magic reverberates to other targets affecting them as well, GM’s choice.
---charming & open
When you **speak frankly with someone**, you can ask their player a question from the list below. They must answer it truthfully, then they may ask you a question from the list (which you must answer truthfully).
• Whom do you serve?
• What do you wish I would do?
• How can I get you to _____?
• What are you really feeling right now?
• What do you most desire?
---bardic lore
Choose an area of expertise:
• Spells and Magicks
• The Dead and Undead
• Grand Histories of the Known World
• A Bestiary of Creatures Unusual
• The Planar Spheres
• Legends of Heroes Past
• Gods and Their Servants
When you **first encounter an important creature, location, or item** (your call) covered by your bardic lore you can ask the GM any one question about it; the GM will answer truthfully. The GM may then ask you what tale, song, or legend you heard that information in.
---a port in the storm
When you **return to a civilized settlement you’ve visited before**, tell the GM when you were last here. They’ll tell you how it’s changed since then.
---divine guidance
When you **petition your deity according to the precept of your religion**, you are granted some useful knowledge or boon related to your deity’s domain. The GM will tell you what.
---cast a spell (wis)
When you **unleash a spell granted by your deity**, roll+WIS. On a 10+ the the spell is successfully cast and your deity does not revoke the spell, so you may cast it again. On a 7-9 the spell is cast, but choose one:
• You draw unwelcome attention or put yourself in a spot. The GM will tell you how.
• Your casting distances you from your deity; take -1 ongoing to cast a spell until the next time you commune.
• After it is cast, the spell is revoked by your deity. You cannot cast the spell again until you commune and have it granted to you.
*Note that maintaining spells with ongoing effects will sometimes cause a penalty to your roll to cast a spell.*
---commune
When you spend uninterrupted time (an hour or so) in **quiet contemplation** with your deity, you:
• Lose any spells already granted to you
• Are granted new spells of your choice whose total levels don’t exceed your own level +1, and none of which is a higher level than your own level
• Prepare all of your rotes, which never count against your limit
---turn undead
When you **hold your holy symbol aloft and call on your deity for protection**, roll+WIS. On a 7+, so long as you continue to pray and brandish your holy symbol, no undead may come within reach of you. On a 10+, you also momentarily daze intelligent undead and cause mindless undead to flee. Aggression breaks the effects and they are able to act as normal.
---hunt & track (wis)
When you **follow a trail of clues left behind by passing creatures**, roll+WIS. On a 7+, you follow the creature’s trail until there’s a significant change in its direction or mode of travel. On a 10+, you also choose 1:

• Determine what caused the trail to end
---called shot

• and you Discern Realities, add its **cunning** to your **roll**
• and you Parley, add its **cunning** to your **roll**
• and someone Interferes with you, add its **instinct** to their **roll**
---trap expert
When you **spend a moment to survey a dangerous area**, roll+DEX. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7–9, hold 1. Spend your hold as you walk through the area to ask these questions:
• Is there a trap here and if so, what activates it?
• What does the trap do when activated?
• What else is hidden here?
---tricks of the trade
When you **pick locks or pockets or disable traps**, roll+DEX. On a 10+, you do it, no problem. On a 7–9, you still do it, but the GM will offer you two options between suspicion, danger, or cost.
---backstab
When you **attack a surprised or defenseless enemy with a melee weapon**, you can choose to deal your damage or roll+DEX. On a 10+, choose two. On a 7–9, choose one:

• You create an advantage, +1 forward to you or an ally acting on it
• Reduce their armor by 1 until they repair it
---flexible morals
When **someone tries to detect your alignment** you can tell them any alignment you like.
---poisoner
You’ve mastered the care and use of a poison. Choose a poison from the list below; that poison is no longer dangerous for you to use. You also start with three uses of the poison you choose. Whenever you have time to gather materials and a safe place to brew you can make three uses of the poison you choose for free. Note that some poisons are applied, meaning you have to carefully apply it to the target or something they eat or drink. Touch poisons just need to touch the target, they can even be used on the blade of a weapon.
• **Oil of Tagit**: (applied) The target falls into a light sleep.
• **Bloodweed**: (touch) The target deals -1d4 damage ongoing until cured.
• **Goldenroot**: (applied) The target treats the next creature they see as a trusted ally, until proved otherwise.
• **Serpent’s Tears**: (touch) Anyone dealing damage to the target rolls twice and takes the better result.
