But after it all started, you were a proud member of the Last Watch, a militia who went about establishing order during the end times. That is until you learned the truth of the Last Watch, whether you walked in on something you shouldn’t have, or maybe you witnessed a massacre in the name of peace and order that made you finally see the truth. Whatever happened, you fled, now there are bounties out for your arrest and you are hunted by former friends and comrades.

**One of the Old Gods**
You're a god, a real deity, not one of those gods of faith either. You are a spirit of a forest, or a river, or a mountain, you didn’t need a bunch of assholes in flowy robes to worship you. You had real power, *had* being the key term there unfortunately, when the apocalypse came, it kinda dried up your river, burned your forest, or toppled your mountain, or whatever it did. But you’re still pretty damn strong, and you wanna have a word with this apocalypse or whatever entity embodies it — they kinda fucked up your whole thing.

**Born of Arcane and Aether**
You were born of magic, a being constructed entirely of it, you know so much, and so little at the same time.

**Artifice of the Fae**
Not too long ago, you found out you were never real. You are a sculpture of bark and mud that some cruel fae enchanted to look human, so you could wander the world of men. Your eyes are crystal spheres so that the fae could look through and marvel at all the mundanes of human life. When the apocalypse came the magic that enchanted your mind was washed away, now you know that you were just a tool for some uncaring fae. What are you now that their influence is gone?

**Professional People Watcher**
You weren’t anyone important. You grew up in a busy enough city that you could escape most people's notice. You didn’t have many friends, so you spent your days scoping people out, following their habits as they went about their lives. Eventually you made it your trade to know where people were and what they were doing, you’d sell the information or use it to steal things here and there to sell or keep. You weren’t too proud of it, but you were definitely good at it.
